# My First Blog Post

*Published on April 14, 2024*

Welcome to my first blog post! This is a simple example of how the blog system works.

## Why I Built This

I wanted a simple way to create and maintain a website without dealing with complex frameworks or build systems. This solution allows me to:

- Write content in Markdown
- Have a clean, modern design
- Keep everything simple and maintainable

## How It Works

The build system takes Markdown files and converts them to HTML using a template. It's that simple!

## What's Next?

I plan to add more features like:

- A contact form
- Newsletter integration
- More interactive elements

Stay tuned for more updates!
